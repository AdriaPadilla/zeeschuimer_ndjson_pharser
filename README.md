# Zeeschuimer TikTok .ndjson file pharser

This is a simple script to pharse zeeschuimer .Ndjson file and dump basic info collected from TikTok, to a "easy to handle" .xlsx file. Note this script is made only for TikTok data. This will not work with other platforms ndjson files.

This script will extract the basic metadata from the .ndjson file, generated by [Zeeschuimer](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer).

Not all data collected and contained in the ndjson file is dumped on the xlsx. If you wish to add more data, feel free to modificate the original script with new keys/values.
