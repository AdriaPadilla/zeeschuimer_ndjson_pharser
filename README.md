# Zeeschuimer TikTok .ndjson file pharser

This is a simple script to pharse zeeschuimer .Ndjson file and dump basic info collected from TikTok, to a "easy to handle" .xlsx file. Note this script is made only for TikTok data. This will not work with other platforms ndjson files.

This script will extract the basic metadata from the .ndjson file, generated by [Zeeschuimer](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer).

Not all data collected and contained in the ndjson file is dumped on the xlsx. If you wish to add more data, feel free to modificate the original script with new keys/values. 

Dependencies
```bash
glob
json
pandas
datetime
ndjson
openpyxl # Needed for .xlsx exports
```

Need to install:
```bash
pip install ndjson
pip install pandas
pip install openpyxl
```

## Make it work:
Place the ndjson file (or files) in the same folder as the .py script.
Open a terminal, navigate to the folder, and type "python3 main.py"
